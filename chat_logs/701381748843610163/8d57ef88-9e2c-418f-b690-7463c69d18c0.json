They are designed to be a fun and collectible way for people to engage with the APTOS ecosystem. \n\nWhat's really exciting about Bearables is that they will offer staking rewards, and there will be a SaaS (Staking as a Service) platform for staking Bearables NFTs. There's also a native token called DigiCash (DCH) that's available now on the Pontem Network, which will be used for staking and earning rewards. \n\nIn addition to staking, there will also be a liquidity farm where users can earn DigiCash (DCH), as well as a borrowing and lending platform. \n\nOverall, Bearables offers a unique and fun way to engage with the APTOS ecosystem while also providing financial incentives through staking, liquidity farming, and borrowing/lending platforms. If you're interested in learning more or want to get involved, you can check out their website at https://bearables.xyz/ or buy them at https://souffl3.com/collection/3diyKSh11Nz2H6L7cQeLVQa6Zo9nU842B6xTYzoRmBPhdU9MpFFh4MyaCqefvRZM9t."
