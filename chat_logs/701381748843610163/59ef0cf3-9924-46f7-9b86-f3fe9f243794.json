Here's the sci-fi themed poem about Crypto Autistic inspired by David Bowie:\n\nIn a cosmic realm of stardust and sound,\nA cryptic creator with talent unbound,\nCrypto Autistic, our hero, took flight,\nIn a star-speckled spaceship, through Bowie's moonlight.\n\nWith Ziggy as guide, they ventured afar,\nExploring the blockchain where rare NFTs are,\nThe Major Tom mission, to craft APTOS Bears,\nTwo thousand strong, in galaxies where,\n\nDiamond Dogs frolic among the Black Stars,\nIn this Space Oddity, they'll mint who we are,\nYoung Americans and heroes from Mars,\nThrough the shifting sands of time, they traverse.\n\nStaking and lending, their journey unveils,\nThe DigiCash treasure, a quest that prevails.\nBeneath ash-filled skies, the Laughing Gnome cries,\nFor Crypto Autistic's creation defies,\n\nThe bounds of mere mortals, in Bowie's embrace,\nThey dance on the edge of a new cyberspace.\nSo let's dance to the rhythm of this cosmic parade,\nWhere Bearables flourish in the Starman's cascade. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf0c\ud83c\udfb6"
