They forgot about the real world, man! Pollution was everywhere, and Mother Nature had enough of it. She was like, \"Alright, you ungrateful humans, it's time for a reality check.\" And so, she unleashed her power \u2013 floods, fires, earthquakes, you name it.\n\nNow picture this: As everything was falling apart around them, people realized they couldn't live in their screens anymore. They had to face the mess they created. It was a wild ride, man. Everyone had to learn how to work together and care for the Earth again. In the end, they formed a new global society based on sustainability and collaboration \u2013 ditching their destructive ways like a bad habit. So that's how the modern era came crashing down and gave birth to something better, dude. Peace out"
