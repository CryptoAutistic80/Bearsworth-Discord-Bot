However, in our recent chats, we talked about APTOS Bearables and DigiCash, including its NFT collection of 2000 bears, staking rewards with the Bearables native token, SaaS (Staking as a Service), DigiCash token, liquidity farming, borrowing and lending platform, and the Crypto Bears game that accepts DigiCash tokens. We also talked briefly about Pinecone, an indexing service. If you have any specific questions or want to chat about something else related to these topics or beyond, please let me know!"
