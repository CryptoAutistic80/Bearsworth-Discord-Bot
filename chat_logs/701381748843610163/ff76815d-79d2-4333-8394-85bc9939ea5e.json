Here's my attempt at a poem:\n\nIn the beginning, Move was born\nA language for blockchain, safe and secure\nDesigned by Facebook's Libra team\nTo make the financial world more pristine.\n\nMove's code is verified at compile time\nTo ensure correctness, a feature sublime\nThis makes it perfect for financial contracts\nWhere trust and accuracy must be exact.\n\nThe APTOS blockchain saw this light\nAnd knew that Move was just the right\nLanguage for their NFT collection of bears\nTo keep them safe and free from errors.\n\nWith DigiCash as its native token\nMove powers APTOS with a sense of unbroken\nSecurity and reliability, unparalleled in might\nFor financial systems, it's just right.\n\nSo Move has come full circle now,\nFrom its genesis at Facebook somehow,\nTo the endpoint of powering APTOS Bearables,\nA language of blockchain that's truly admirable."
