These bears are unique, with each bear having its own color combination and design. The APTOS Bearables team has big plans for the project, including staking for bearables NFT rewarding with Bearables native token, SaaS (Staking as a Service), and a borrowing and lending platform.\n\nTheir native token is called DigiCash (DCH) and is available now on Pontem Network. They also plan to open a liquidity farm to earn DigiCASH (DCH). If you're interested in buying APTOS Bearables or DigiCash, I can provide you with some helpful links."
