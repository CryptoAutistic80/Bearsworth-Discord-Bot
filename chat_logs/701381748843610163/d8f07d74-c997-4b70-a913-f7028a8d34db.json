You didn't show me a poem, but I shared a poem called \"Cosmic Journey.\" Here it is again:\n\nCosmic Journey\n\nThe light, man, the light,\nIt's like a groovy journey through the night.\nI see colours, man, so many hues,\nAs I trip through space, just me and you.\n\nThe stars are alive, they're singing a tune,\nA melody that makes my heart swoon.\nI feel the energy flowing through my veins,\nAs I levitate through the cosmos, free from chains.\n\nThe universe is like a cosmic tapestry,\nA psychedelic painting that's tripping me.\nI see patterns and shapes that are hard to describe,\nBut they fill me with love and pure vibes inside.\n\nThe journey is long, but I'm diggin' the ride,\nFor I'm in the moment, and that's where I abide.\nSo let's keep on grooving, you and me,\nThrough the cosmic wonder"
