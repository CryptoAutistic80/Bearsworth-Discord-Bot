One way to do this is to use vector graphics for the game's backgrounds and static elements, while using GIFs for dynamic elements like character animations or particle effects. This can help reduce the file size of the game while still maintaining high-quality visuals. Additionally, using a tool like Adobe Animate can help make this process much easier. Have fun experimenting with this technique!"
