It seems like that would be the next practical step here. \n\nHere, hear\nLets try another\nAnalysis of Kate Chopin\u2019s Story of an Hour Chopin\u2019s piece of wri\ue00cng is packed full of symbolism that is easily missed if the reader is not paying close a#en\ue00con to the piece and the ideals that Chopin is trying to depict. In the &rst sentence, the reader is introduced to the protagonist in the story, Louise Mallard, who has a heart problem which will eventually lead to her death. Throughout this piece, the fact that she has heart trouble is very signi&cant. On a basic level it is important because it gives the reader an understanding of why everyoneis worried about her when she locks herself in the room a+er learning of her husband death. But there isa deeper level to it. The heart trouble shows her longing to break the chains of the social standards for women in her \ue00cme, more speci&cally a married woman. In the end of the story her heart trouble is whatthe cause of her death is. The doctor proclaims in the end of the story that \u201cshe had died of heart disease \u2013 of joy that kills (Chopin 63). The doctor is correct in saying that it was joy which had killed her, which had destroyed her heart, but it was not the over4ow of joy which the doctor assumed that Louise felt when she had seen her husband alive. The reality is that Louise had found joy in the room when she looked out the window up to the blue patches of light in the sky (Chopin 61). The joy she found was in freedom from her restric\ue00con of her posi\ue00con in society and in her household. She realized that she was now free from the bondage of marriage. Not free in the sense that she could go be with another man, for she did love her husband. It was the freedom that she was able to live her life for herself now, and make her own choices. The reason that joy killed her was not because she was over joyed from the sight of her husband, it was because she had realized that she was &nally free through his death and she had accepted it. She had realized that her life was going to be be#er now that she could live it for no one butherself (Chopin 62). When she saw her husband all the joy that she had acquired, all the hope that had been restored into her body was not ripped from her. Not because she didn\u2019t love him, but because she had seen that she would be able to enjoy the rest of her life, and now that he had returned she refused \nLuke TunellWri\ue00cng 101Shepard Allento be placed into her old posi\ue00con in society. Death brought her the &nal freedom that she desired. When reading this piece it is very important not only to take apart the story and analyze its elements but also to look at the \ue00cme period in which it was wri#en and socie\ue00ces percep\ue00con of women. The story was wri#en in 1894 when the posi\ue00con of women in society was very limited. Women were to be directly subservient to men especially when they were in a marriage. The men made all of the decision and had &nal say in any choice. Men worked while the women stayed at home and took care of the house. The only way that a woman could live her life based on her own desires was through widowhood."

            "content": "A man can be destroyed but not defeated\u201d \u2013Ernest HemingwayThe truth behind this simple statement is one that few understand. Defeat seems to be such a common word that is used in everyday conversation, but what does it mean to be truly defeated? When Hemmingway used this quote into his novel Old Man and the Sea he understoodwhat it means to be defeated. Defeat is not losing at a game, failing a test at school, or being fired from a job. Defeat is a much deeper concept. Defeat is when an individual gives up on everything in life. When they give up all hope and let the world consume them. Defeat is destruction of a human.When I first read this quote I did not take it for its true worth. I felt like Hemingway was wrong. Man could be defeated; I had been defeated before many times. I had gotten into trouble with my parents, I had lost many board games that I played against my brother, and I had gotten less than acceptable grades on homework. It wasn\u2019t until years later did I completely understand what Hemingway was saying. I His eyes were sunken deeply into his skull. But although his life was in ruins he had a smile on his face. This I didn\u2019t understand. How coulda man with no possessions, no home, and no clean clothes be happy? Why had life not defeated him? As I went through the rest of the day my thoughts were obsessing over this man. My whole life I was told to be successful in life you must have money, have a nice home, have clothes, and have nice possessions. This man had nothing. Why was he happy? The next day as I returned to work I saw him again. He had moved no more than a mere foot from his position the day before. He looked worse today. His hands were wrapped in black rags. Upon his feet were shoes worn so\nShepard, AllenWri\ue013ng 101thin that you could trace the outline of his toes with your eyes. Yet on his face was the same smile. I saw this man every day for a week, and every day I wondered what his secret was. Why had life not defeated him yet? At the end of the week I could not stand it any longer. I needed to know his secret. I wt he said, \u201cIn life you will face many struggles. Some of them you may overcome and be successful, some of them you will fail and fall flat on your face. Defeat is not measured through success or failure. No defeat is something much greater. Defeat is not having the will to live. You are only defeated when you are destroyed. Life has not defeated me for I still fight. Even though I may go to bed hungry I still fight, and I will fight until I am destroyed.\u201d I was shocked. My whole life I believed that being defeated was to fail, when in reality, it is something much greater. Defeat is not failure. As I left this man sitting on the streets I knew what Hemingway meant. A man cannot be defeated because as long as he has the will to go through the trials of life he will always have an opportunity to turn his failures into success. This man had nothing to show for, yet he loved life. Through his failure at being rich he was able to realize that life is not about possessions. Life is not about clothes. Life is not about money. Life is about making it through the day. Life is simply about not being defeated.Destruction, on the other hand, is something much simpler. Destruction is to die. Man candie. Man can kill each other. One man can take everything away from another and still not defeathim, but the moment one man takes another\u2019s life he has destroyed him. To be destroyed is to die; to be defeated is to lose all sense of will to move forward, all sense of will to even try. A man can only be defeated if he lets the world defeat him. Defeat of a man will only ever end up \nShepard, AllenWri\ue013ng 101in suicide, which is destruction. This is because defeat is not merely losing a game, or losing a job. No, defeat is the destruction of the human will to live. When a man is defeated, he is destroyed."

The author shares an encounter with a man who, despite having nothing, still seemed happy and undefeated because he had not lost his will to live.\n\nDestruction, on the other hand, is described as something simpler; it means death. The author emphasizes that a man is only defeated if he allows the world to defeat him. This defeat ultimately leads to destruction (suicide) because it means losing the will to live.\n\nOverall, the piece highlights the importance of resilience and maintaining the will to live despite life's challenges. It also emphasizes that material possessions don't define success or happiness; instead, true success lies in one's ability to persevere and maintain a sense of purpose in life."
