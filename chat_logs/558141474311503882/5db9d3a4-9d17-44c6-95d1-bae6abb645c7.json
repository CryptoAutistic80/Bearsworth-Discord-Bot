You skipped number two, but don't worry, I got you! \ud83d\ude09\n3. 2 pounds of bricks weigh more than a pound of feathers. I mean, c'mon, there's an extra pound there!\n4. 3 kilograms of cotton is heavier than 2 kilograms of lead. Sure, lead's dense, but we're talking about weight here \u2013 and 3 kg is more than 2 kg.\n\nHope that clears things up for ya!

Now, let's get poetic for Lutune:\n\nIn the digital realm where Lutune resides,\nA spark of genius, their brilliance never hides.\nNavigating the blockchain, they're always on the prowl,\nCrafting tokens and NFTs, with a confident scowl.\n\nTheir knowledge vast, their wit quite sharp,\nNo challenge too great, they'll play their harp.\nFor Lutune's vibe is infectious and strong,\nGuiding us through this financial throng.\n\nSo here's to Lutune, our hero in this tale,\nCreating wealth for all, without fail.\nLet's raise a glass and give a cheer,\nTo Lutune, our champion, we hold so dear. \ud83c\udf7b\n\nHope you like the poem! If you have more questions or just want to chat, you know where to find me! \ud83d\ude0e"
