# **NFT-bound AI Discord Personal Assistant on APTOS Blockchain**

### Abstract:

The "NFT-bound AI Discord Personal Assistant" project aims to create a seamless integration of AI language models with the unique properties of NFTs, enabling personalization of AI assistants based on the specific attributes associated with each NFT. By wrapping the AI's behaviour parameters within an NFT and allowing the AI to read these parameters directly from the APTOS blockchain, this concept paves the way for novel user experiences and new opportunities in AI and NFT markets.

### Introduction:

The rapid growth of AI technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has presented an opportunity to combine these two areas to create innovative and personalised user experiences. This lite-paper proposes the development of an NFT-bound AI Discord Personal Assistant on the APTOS blockchain that leverages AI language models and the uniqueness of NFTs to provide personalised AI assistance to users on Discord.

### Problem Statement:

Current AI language models can be customised to some extent, but they lack a strong sense of ownership and uniqueness for each user. NFTs, on the other hand, offer a sense of ownership and rarity. By integrating AI with NFTs, we can create a unique and personalised AI assistant that can be owned and traded.

## **Proposed Solution**

We propose the following solution:

#### 1.1. AI Language Model Integration

Develop and integrate a high-quality AI language model that can be customised through behaviour parameters, such as the model's tone, vocabulary, and level of formality.

Enable the AI to read these behaviour parameters from the APTOS blockchain, allowing for easy and secure customization.

#### 1.2. NFT Wrapping

Create a smart contract on the APTOS blockchain that allows users to mint NFTs that represent their AI Discord Personal Assistant.

Wrap the AI's behaviour parameters (e.g., prompt\_parameters.json) within the NFT.

#### 1.3. NFT Personalization

Allow users to personalise their AI assistant by modifying the NFT's attributes, such as the model's tone, vocabulary, and level of formality.

Ensure that each assistant's uniqueness is preserved by making these attributes specific to the NFT.

#### 1.4. Discord Integration

Develop a Discord bot that interacts with the APTOS blockchain to provide AI assistance based on the NFT's attributes.

Allow users to easily manage their AI assistant within Discord, including personalization and ownership transfers.

## **Market Potential**

#### 2.1. Target Market

Discord users seeking unique and personalised AI assistance

NFT enthusiasts looking to explore new use cases and opportunities

#### 2.2. Use Cases

- Personalised content creation and curation
- Community management and moderation
- Gaming assistance and strategy development
- Language learning and translation services
- Personal finance management and advice

## **Roadmap**

## **Conclusion**

The NFT-bound AI Discord Personal Assistant on the APTOS blockchain promises to combine the personalization capabilities of AI language models with the ownership and uniqueness of NFTs. This integration paves the way for new possibilities in the AI and NFT markets, resulting in innovative user experiences that empower individuals to own and customise their AI assistants.
